## Window Managers

### Linux - [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)

Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that also looks good.

> I used to run [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3), but we moved on.

## Mac Os - [yabaii](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)

Yabaii is a tilling window manager for MacOS (it's ðŸ”¥ blazingly ðŸ”¥ slow)

> **_NOTE:_** I finally moved away from yabaii to aerospace(check out `./.aerospace.toml`)

## [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) | [NeoVim (btw)](https://neovim.io/) | [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

The best terminal emulator. (started using ghostty on MacOs, seems fast and fine, but not much different from kitty)

I use NeoVim btw

## [tmuxp](https://tmuxp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -> [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)

Tmuxp is a [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session manager. you can specify your window/pane arangement with a config file and it will start your session as specified.
Checkout my session configs at `tmuxp-sessions/`

> **_NOTE:_** recently I moved to tmuxinator(check out `./.config/tmuxinator`)
